## Credits
 Many thanks to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) documentation and [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for availing resources online. I found their resources very useful throughout the course of my project. Their efforts in availing the resources was very instrumental in the success of my project. I would choose them over again and recommend any individual to check on their resources whenever they'd want anything code related.
